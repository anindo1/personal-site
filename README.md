# Personal Website

This is my personal website. You can visit it at https://anindyade.com/

It was made through React in combination of many other libraries.

## Dependencies

Tested with: [node](https://nodejs.org/) >= v12 and optional [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for managing node versions.

## Set up

To download the repository and install dependencies, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anindo1/personal-site.git # replace [anindo1] with your github username if you fork first.
cd personal-site
nvm install # this is optional - make sure you're running >= node 12 with `node --version`
npm install
```

## Running

Run the following command to build the react application and serve it with fast refresh:

```bash
npm start
```

Your web browser should automatically open to `<ip>:<port>:<path>` default: [http://localhost:3000/personal-site](http://localhost:3000/personal-site).
